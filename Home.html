        <p>How Do All-Electric Cars Work?<br>
            All-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. <br>
            The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment, <br>
            also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not contain<br>
            the typical liquid fuel components, such as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank</p>
