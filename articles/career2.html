           <br>Newly created Job roles
           <br>Artificial Intelligence. AI is used throughout the Motor Industry and as AI is still evolving there are no shortage of opportunities for University Graduates.<br> AI is used for everything from Vehicle Design (think aerodynamics) to self-driving vehicles.
           <br>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-emerging industry, and even though it focuses on automated services, from AI virtual assistants such as Siri to email spam filters,<br> human engineers are still required to design and maintain these systems. As the industry continues to grow, the higher the demand will be for people to fill these roles.<br> Exciting developments in this up-and-coming field include the likes of self-driving cars and facial recognition technology for paying at a store. AI pros can make a lot of money, especially if they assist in the creation of brand-new AI products.
           <br> Robotics technicians - Robots are an excellent tool for automating welding processes in car production, as robots can both perform the actual welding whilst handling the relevant parts. <br>Common uses include arc welding and resistance spot welding, with arc welding accounting for roughly 20% of all industrial robotic applications.
           <br>Robots need regular Software and Hardware maintenance and this specialises role is well paid – training as an embedded software Engineer is a good place to start.
           <br>Electric Car Conversion. Electric cars are still an expensive option and due to a shortage of parts, the lead times on some EVs isas long as a year! This queue can be cut but converting a Petrol car into Electric.
           <br>The basic process for converting a car to electric power involves removing the combustion engine, along with the gearbox, exhaust, and various other components. These are then replaced with batteries and one or more electric motors.
           <br>However, the reality is that you will need specialist mechanical and high-voltage electrical knowledge, as well as plenty of spare time.
           <br>Electric Car Technician - As Electric Vehicles start to take over the roads, mechanics trained in this new electric technology are needed too. Despite a similar job title,<br> up to 97% of classically-trained mechanics aren’t qualified to switch to working on electric cars because of the specialist knowledge it requires.
           <br> Apprenticeships and University Courses are becoming available. At the forefront of electric vehicle technology is the world’s most valuable automaker, <br>Tesla who now run their own education programme to train a new generation of technicians.
           <br> As Tesla haven’t started building in the UK yet, it might be the perfect to time to train and be the first on the bus to the next UK Gigafactory.
